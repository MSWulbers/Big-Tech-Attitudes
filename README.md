## Content

1. VADER Sentiment Analysis

I use the VADER sentiment lexicon (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) to perform sentiment analysis on textual Reddit data. This serves to analyse public sentiment towards Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple during 2018, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal was revealed. 

2. Tf-Idf Word Frequencies

Word frequency analysis is conducted using tf-idf to extract keywords from Reddit comments.

3. Word2Vec Word Embeddings

Using Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), word embeddings are leveraged to assess semantic relationships between the terms 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Facebook', 'Apple' and ‘Cambridge Analytica'.
